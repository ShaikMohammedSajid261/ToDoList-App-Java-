# ToDoList App
 Task Remainder App:
 Description:
To Create a to-do list application using Android Studio involves developing a user-friendly interface to manage tasks efficiently. Utilizing Java as the programming language and SQLite as the database, the app will enable users to add, edit, and delete tasks seamlessly. The application will consist of various components, such as an input form for task entry, a list view to display existing tasks, and options for task manipulation. Java classes will be employed to handle the logic behind task operations, and SQLite will serve as the backend database to store task data persistently. The app will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to ensure a comprehensive task management experience. Users can interact with the application through intuitive buttons and gestures, and the SQLite database will be responsible for storing and retrieving task details efficiently. The integration of Android Studio, Java, and SQLite will result in a robust to-do list application that provides a seamless and user-friendly task management experience on Android devices

Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have Android Studio installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Android developer website: Android Studio Download.

Familiarize yourself with Java programming basics, as the application is developed using Java.

Setting up the Project:

Open Android Studio and select "Start a new Android Studio project."
Choose an appropriate project template and configure the project settings.
Set up the project with an appropriate package name, save location, and language (Java).
Select an activity template, such as "Empty Activity" or "Basic Activity," and proceed to create the project.
Designing the User Interface:

Navigate to the "res" directory in the project and open the "layout" folder.
Modify the "activity_main.xml" file to design the user interface. Include elements like EditText for task entry, ListView for displaying tasks, and buttons for task operations.
Implementing Java Classes:

Create Java classes for handling task operations. Consider classes for database management (SQLiteOpenHelper), task model, and main activity.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the appropriate Java classes. Utilize SQLite queries to interact with the database.
Database Configuration:

Set up the SQLite database in the "SQLiteOpenHelper" class. Define the table structure and necessary columns for storing task details.
Handling User Interactions:

Implement event listeners for buttons and user interactions in the main activity Java class.
Integrate the logic for adding, updating, and deleting tasks based on user inputs.
Testing:

Run the application on an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to your computer.
Resolve any errors or issues that may arise during compilation and execution.
